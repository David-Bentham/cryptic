# cryptic
A simple Python tool that generates cryptic crossword-style clues by combining definitions, synonyms, and wordplay patterns. Originally built as an experiment in natural language transformation and combinatorial clue logic.

## Features
- Clue construction using synonyms and surface-level misdirection
- Basic parser logic to combine clue segments
- Simple in-memory clue bank for testing

## Why This?
While built for fun, `cryptic` reflects an interest in structured ambiguity, language systems, and generative logic â€” useful in both puzzle design and adversarial thinking contexts.

## Status
Archived and infrequently maintained, but functional.
